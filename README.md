# ng-scaffold

## What is it?

This is an [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) application scaffold. It's inspired by [angular-app](https://github.com/angular-app/angular-app). So the JavaScript and other source code is **organized in modules** and not "by layer". It also provides a build, test and basic deployment process based on [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [Bower](http://bower.io/) and [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/). You can use this skeleton as a starting point for frontend development with AngularJS.

In addition the ng-scaffold project is the groundwork for [generator-ng-scaffold](https://github.com/nosch/generator-ng-scaffold), a [yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for AngularJS.

## Installation

1. Install [node.js and npm](http://nodejs.org/download/ "Download node.js")
2. $ npm install -g grunt-cli
3. $ git clone git@github.com:nosch/ng-scaffold.git "ng-scaffold"
4. $ cd ng-scaffold
5. $ npm install

## How to use
### Develop and build process

Start to develop, to test (incl. code coverage with Istanbul and reports with Plato) and finally to build an AngularJS application with one of the following grunt tasks.

- $ grunt server (default)
- $ grunt test
- $ grunt coverage (generates test/coverage/)
- $ grunt report (generates reports/)
- $ grunt release

### End-To-End testing with protractor

Run e2e test with [protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor):

1. $ npm install -g protractor
2. $ webdriver-manager update
3. $ grunt server
4. $ protractor test/config/protractor.conf.js
